# LiftLab - Current Issues & Status 🚧

## 🎯 **What's Working Well:**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: SimulationEngine + useSimulationEngine hook
- ✅ **Visual Design**: Beautiful pastel elevators, passenger circles with numbers
- ✅ **Basic Simulation**: Elevators pick up/drop off passengers
- ✅ **UI Layout**: Sidebar controls, metrics, canvas visualization
- ✅ **State Management**: Zustand store, React integration
- ✅ **Elevator States**: "Loading", "Going Up", "Idle" text display

## ✅ **Recently Fixed Problems:**

### **1. Spawn Rate Slider Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: Moving the slider didn't change passenger generation rate
**Root Cause**: Spawner recreation instead of direct rate update
**Solution**: 
- Changed `updateConfig()` to call `spawner.setSpawnRate()` directly
- Removed test passengers that were masking spawning behavior  
- Enabled spawn rate slider during simulation
**Status**: **FIXED** - Slider now updates passenger generation rate in real-time

### **2. Speed Control Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: Speed slider didn't affect simulation speed
**Root Cause**: `PrecisionTicker.setTickRate()` didn't restart ticker with new rate
**Solution**: 
- Modified `setTickRate()` to restart ticker if currently running
- Added immediate application of new tick rate
**Status**: **FIXED** - Speed slider now changes simulation speed instantly

### **3. Elevator Animations Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: Elevators jumped between floors instead of smooth movement
**Root Cause**: Animation state conflicts with rapid simulation updates
**Solution**:
- Added animation tracking to prevent position override during tweens
- Improved animation logic with proper cleanup
- Faster 0.8s animation duration for better responsiveness
**Status**: **FIXED** - Elevators now smoothly animate between floors

## 🔍 **Debugging Added:**
- Console logs for spawn rate slider changes
- Console logs for speed slider changes  
- Console logs for engine config updates
- Console logs for spawner recreation
- Console logs for ticker creation and speed setting

## 📁 **Key Files & Their Status:**

### **Core Architecture (Working):**
- `packages/web/src/engine/SimulationEngine.ts` - Main simulation logic ✅
- `packages/web/src/hooks/useSimulationEngine.ts` - React integration ✅
- `packages/sim/src/algorithms.ts` - Clean elevator algorithm ✅

### **UI Components (Working):**
- `packages/web/src/App.tsx` - Main app with controls ✅
- `packages/web/src/components/BuildingCanvas.tsx` - Visualization ✅
- `packages/web/src/store.ts` - Zustand state management ✅

### **Problem Areas (Needs Investigation):**
- **Config propagation**: Changes not reaching simulation
- **Ticker speed control**: `setTickRate` not working
- **Animation system**: Konva animations not executing

## 🧪 **Next Steps for Debugging:**

### **1. Spawn Rate Issue:**
- [ ] Verify config changes trigger useEffect in useSimulationEngine
- [ ] Check if spawner is actually being recreated
- [ ] Test if new spawner config is different from old
- [ ] Verify spawner.nextTick() uses new rate

### **2. Speed Control Issue:**
- [ ] Check if ticker.setTickRate() method exists and works
- [ ] Verify speed changes during simulation vs before
- [ ] Test if ticker is the right instance
- [ ] Check tick rate calculation math

### **3. Animation Issue:**
- [ ] Test Konva.Tween in isolation
- [ ] Check if animations conflict with state updates
- [ ] Verify elevator position updates aren't overriding animations
- [ ] Consider using React-based animations instead

## 🎯 **Potential Root Causes:**

### **Most Likely:**
1. **State Update Timing**: React state changes not propagating to simulation engine
2. **Ticker Implementation**: `setTickRate` method not working as expected
3. **Animation Conflicts**: Rapid state updates overriding Konva animations

### **Less Likely:**
1. **Build Issues**: TypeScript compilation problems
2. **Import Issues**: Wrong versions of libraries
3. **Browser Issues**: Konva or React compatibility

## 🔧 **Alternative Approaches to Consider:**

### **For Spawn Rate:**
- Direct spawner property modification instead of recreation
- Force simulation restart when config changes
- Use refs for immediate config updates

### **For Speed Control:**
- Custom ticker implementation with better speed control
- React-based timing using useInterval
- Direct deltaTime multiplication instead of tick rate

### **For Animations:**
- CSS animations instead of Konva
- React Spring for smooth transitions
- Manual interpolation between positions

## 📊 **Current Configuration:**
- **Base tick rate**: 10 TPS
- **Speed range**: 0.25x - 4x
- **Spawn rate range**: 1-20 passengers/minute
- **Animation duration**: 1 second
- **Elevator timing**: 1.5s travel, 1.5s door ops, 2s hold
